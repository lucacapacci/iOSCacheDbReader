iOS Cache.db reader
================

An SQLite reader that shows the BLOB fields containing binary plists as XML human-readable text. This allows pentesters to easily read the content of Cache.db files generated by iOS applications.

Written in Java and thus compatible with many operating systems.

You can compile the jar yourself or download the precompiled one [here](https://github.com/lucacapacci/iOSCacheDbReader/raw/master/iOSCacheDbReader.jar).
